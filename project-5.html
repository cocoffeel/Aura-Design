                              <p>This project involves creating a restaurant brand from scratch, informed by research on local businesses along East Hastings St in Vancouver. Starting with the demographics of the neighbourhood, I developed the brand identity from the brand story to various touchpoints. The main deliverables include the brand identity guide, storefront, packaging, menu, uniforms, and more.</p>

                        <h2>About the Brand</h2>
                        <h3>Demographics</h3>
                        <p>Hastings-Sunrise is a primarily residential neighborhood featuring New Brighton Park with its waterfront and numerous facilities. The area benefits from good transit and an abundance of restaurants and stores. It has a large immigrant population, historically Italian-Canadian and now predominantly Chinese. The population is aging, with a low rate of new residents. There are more owned households than rented ones, and many households have children.</p><br>
                        <h3>Brand Story</h3>
                        <p>Sichuan cuisine is one of the four major styles of cooking in China. Chuan Noodle is founded by a homesick immigrant who wants to bring the special cuisine to Vancouver. Chuan Noodle offers authentic rice noodles from Sichuan, China – a beloved and distinctive cuisine. Reflecting the warmth and optimism of Sichuanese culture, Chuan Noodle embodies rich flavors, spiciness, and versatility.</p>

                        <h2>Logo</h2>
                        <p>For the logo process, the goal was to blend Chinese culture with the noodle house vibe, not simply by including Chinese characters. The image of a river flowing from a mountain to the ocean was chosen for its cultural significance. ‘Chuan’ (川) means river in Chinese, and the saying ‘All rivers flow into the ocean’ (海纳百川) reflects the generous and welcoming nature of the Sichuan people. Sichuan is also known for its mountains, and ‘Chuan’ is often paired with the word for mountain (山). The three wavy lines represent both noodles and rivers while mimicking the Chinese character ‘川’. The words ‘Chuan Noodle’ were incorporated into the icon to complete the design. However, the mountain appeared visually heavier than the elements beneath. To lighten it, I experimented with different directions and settled on using three lines and shades to create volume and suggest lighting.</p>

                    <section class="text">
                        <p>Despite this, the design felt too symbolic and lacked the feel of a restaurant. To address this, I trimmed the bottom of the icon into a bowl shape to better convey the noodle house concept. I also separated the wordmark from the icon to improve legibility and responsiveness. A hibiscus, a local flower, was added to fill the space between the chopstick and ocean, also serving as a pattern on the bowl. Unlike the other elements, the flower was hand-drawn and traced in Illustrator to maintain a natural touch. The thick edge of the flower echoes the style of the mountain and balances its weight. Additional details include thicker lines on the bottom and right for balance and to indicate lighting.</p><br>
                        <p>The wordmark is customized from the typeface FinalSix, whose wide and rounded shape conveys a friendly appearance. All lowercase letters were used to emphasize the restaurant's stress-free atmosphere. The carved ends and the even stroke weights of the typeface evoke the look of noodles. To create smooth curves and avoid straight lines, the edges of the letters were trimmed. The logo was finalized using grids and adheres to the golden ratio wherever possible.</p>

                        <p>I chose a monochrome color palette to reflect the casual and welcoming feel of the restaurant. Red, symbolizing luck, prosperity, and celebration in Chinese culture, also represents passion and energy. It is known to stimulate appetite and is commonly used in the branding of restaurants and food products. A white with a pink touch was selected as another primary colour to enhance the logo’s visibility and impact against a red background in various scenarios.</p>

                        <h2>Typography</h2>
                        <p>Except for the logo, FinalSix is also used for body text and subtitle. It has rounded tops and bottoms, creating a wavy feeling. The characters are fun and neatly shaped, echoing the structure found in Chinese characters. The inviting look and good readability makes it ideal for versatile designs including menu and website.</p><br>
                        <p>Novibes Display is used for print titles such as posters, flyers, and packaging due to its playful and blocky feel. Its similar structure to Finalfix makes it a complementary pairing.</p>

                        <h2>Brand in Use</h2>
                        <p>Playful illustrations with fluid lines are key visual elements for the project. A character of a chef was designed to represent the restaurant's friendliness, with a cartoony look and exaggerated features to depict iconic scenes of making and serving noodles. Clean and thin lines maintain consistency with the logo design. The repeated use and combinations of elements like the mountain, flower, and river strengthen the brand identity and allow for various designs in different scenarios.</p><br>
                        <p>The flyer design prioritizes the hierarchy of information. A wavy line separates different content groups, while the curved slogan at the top draws attention. For the sandwich board, the lower content is less visible due to the viewing angles, making it essential to place key information at the top. Memorable graphics and concise information make the board more accessible and engaging for passersby.</p>

The weight and density of lines were carefully selected and experimented with to ensure detailed and cohesive visuals. The postcard design takes a more elegant direction with a Zen vibe, embodying a concentrated reflection of Chinese aesthetics. The Chinese typeface was chosen and customized to match the characteristics of Finalfix, including the curvature of the strokes.</p>

                        <p>The rice noodles with different flavours are the merchandise of the brand, aimed at expanding brand influence and increasing customer engagement. The size and proportions of the package are designed to accommodate the characteristics and volume of the rice noodles. Viewers’ attention is guided by the text towards the focal point—the hero illustration. The text layout narrows from top to bottom, forming a bowl shape. Iconic wavy lines are used on the front and back to add movement and enliven the design. The Chinese character “川” visually connects the waves, creating a subtle continuity. The slogan 'Relive memories in one bite' is placed at the top of the box, offering an expressive message when the customer opens it.</p><br>
                        <p>On the back of the box, the brand story is showcased to enhance brand recognition. A set of custom icons illustrating the cooking process is designed to organize the text effectively.</p>

                        <p>An 8.5”x11” one-page design is chosen for the menu, balancing content and convenience. The menu is bilingual, with careful attention to the visual harmony between Chinese and English. Having more strokes and complex structures, Chinese characters are presented in lighter weights before or after the heavier text to avoid breaking the natural reading flow. A set of custom icons for flavours are designed to enhance accessibility. An eye-catching logo at the top and an illustration at the bottom highlight the relaxing vibe and create a contrast with the content in the middle.</p>

                        <h2>Summary</h2>
                        <p>This project serves as a practice in brand identity design. Based on brand positioning and emphasis, various special collateral items were designed, including utensils, punch cards, packaging, and menus. By adopting the perspective of both the brand owner and customers, I selected items that are both engaging and useful. The key outcomes include the development of industry-standard brand guidelines, the application of brand identity across different media, and a heightened awareness of materials and environments.</p><br>
                        <p>Working with a single colour presented another challenge. Emphasis on typography hierarchy, spacing, and layout was crucial. Creating contrast through line weights and colour proportions added movement to the designs, while the use of proximity ensured consistency and cohesion.</p>
